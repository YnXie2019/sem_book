# Preface

Structural equation modeling is among the fastest growing statistical techniques in the natural sciences, thanks in large part to new advances and software packages that make it broadly applicable and easy to use.

This book is meant to be an approachable guide to the theory, math, and application of SEM. It integrates code from popular open-source packages such as *lavaan* and *piecewiseSEM*. Each chapter ends with worked examples from the published literature.

Moreover, as the author of the *piecewiseSEM* package, this format allows me to document newly-deployed functionality in the package, such as the addition of multigroup analysis and composite variables, new forms of standardization, and updates to model R<sup>2</sup>s.

Happy reading!
